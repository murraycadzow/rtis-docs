## Workshops

### Carpentries Workshops


The Carpentries (https://carpentries.org) is a global organistation that teaches foundational 
coding and data science skils to researchers world-wide. University of Otago is a member organistation 
of the Carpentries and uses the **Software** and **Data** Carpentry curriculums for workshops. Each year we also train
new instructors through instructor training workshops.




#### Software Carpentry


A Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org) workshop is a hands-on training that covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team. 
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding. 


A Software Carpentry workshop is taught by at least one trained and badged instructor. Over the course of the workshop, 
instructors teach our three core topics: the Unix shell, version control with Git, and a programming language (Python or R).



#### Data Carpentry



Data Carpentry's (https://datacarpentry.org) focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis 
in all domains of research. Our lessons are domain-specific, and build on the existing knowledge of learners 
to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Our initial target audience is learners 
who have little to no prior computational experience. We create a friendly environment for learning to empower 
researchers and enable data driven discovery.
