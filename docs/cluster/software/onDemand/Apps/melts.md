The MELTS GUI can be [accessed via the Open OnDemand Applications](https://ondemand.otago.ac.nz/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood_melts_apptainer).

The launcher allows for the selection of the different versions/models;

  * rhyolite-MELTS v. 1.0.2 (original version, with corrections) - old H2O model, no mixed fluids.
  * rhyolite-MELTS v, 1.1.0 (mixed fluid version that perserves the ternary minimum) - old H2O model.
  * rhyolite-MELTS v. 1.2.0 (mixed fluid version optimal for mafic and alkalic melts) - new H2O model.
  * pMELTS v. 5.6.1 (original version, with corrections) - - old H2O model, no mixed fluids.
