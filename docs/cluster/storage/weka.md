## Faster Scratch Storage (WEKA Storage Pool)


The WEKA Storage cluster is mounted on the Aoraki compute cluster at ``/weka/<Research Group>`` or ``/weka/<user>``. The `WEKA platform <https://www.weka.io/>`_ is a high-performance storage solution ideal for **temporary data** used in high-performance computing jobs.

### When to use /weka/ storage

* High I/O Performance
   Fast scratch storage typically offers higher input/output (I/O) performance compared to regular storage solutions. This can significantly speed up tasks that involve large amounts of data read/write operations, such as simulations, data analysis, and scientific computations.


The WEKA cluster, with its all-flash array and 100Gb networking, is ideal for high-speed data handling and ensures optimal performance for your high-performance computing tasks.
