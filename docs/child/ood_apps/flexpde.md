## FlexPDE


The FlexPDE GUI can be accessed via the Open OnDemand Applications.

The FlexPDE Lite (evaluation) configuration is free to use but wil be restricted in the number of simultaneous equations and mesh cells.

FlexPDE Professional can be Internet-activated with an appropriate serial number. Do note that the license activation is machine-based so will need to be deactivated and reactivated on subsequent runs unless the same node is selected.
