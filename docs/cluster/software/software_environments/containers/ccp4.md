# CCP4

The [CCP4](https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/) (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4) program suite provides an integrated suite of programs for determination of macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography.

The ccp4i2 GUI can be accessed via the Open OnDemand Applications.

CCP4 is made available on the cluster as a shared [Apptainer](../apptainer) container image. To run CCP4 binaries within the container, prefix any command with the name of the apptainer image, `ccp4.sif`.

Alternatively you can enter an interactive shell in the container with:

!!! terminal

    ```bash
    ccp4.sif /bin/bash
    ```
