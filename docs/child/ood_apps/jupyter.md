## Jupyter Lab


Jupyter Lab can be accessed via the Open OnDemand applications.

This app features a number of domain-focused or application-specific variants. These containerised software stacks are immutable which promotes consistency and reproducibility.

The different environments are based on the [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io) images, maintained by the Jupyter team.

Contact us if you require a customised environment.
