# Connectome Workbench

[Connectome Workbench](https://humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench) is an open-source visualization and discovery tool used to explore data generated by the Human Connectome Project.


## via OnDemand

The Connectome Workbench wb_view GUI is [available as an Open OnDemand app](https://ondemand.otago.ac.nz/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood_connectome_workbench_apptainer).


## via commandline/Slurm

Connectome Workbench is made available on the cluster as a shared [Apptainer](../apptainer) container image.
You can use the `apptainer/connectome_workbench` module to add convenient aliases to running any of the FSL binaries within the container:

!!! terminal

    ```bash
    module load apptainer/connectome_workbench
    # The following is required to use aliases in a non-interactive/SLURM batch script:
    shopt -s expand_aliases
    wb_commnd ....
    ```

Alternatively run with apptainer directly; i.e. to run binaries within the container, prefix any command with `apptainer run $APPTAINER_IMG/<apptainer_image.sif>`. 

To get an interactive shell into the container:

!!! terminal

    ```bash    
    apptainer run $APPTAINER_IMG/connectome_workbench-<version>.sif /bin/bash
    ```

Within the container, you'll find the binaries under `/opt/workbench/``

These can also be invoked directly within the context of the container, with:

!!! terminal
    
    ```bash
    apptainer run $APPTAINER_IMG/connectome_workbench-<version>.sif wb_command ...
    ```
